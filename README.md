# Purple Bubble Client

This is Purple Bubble's core project - a simple, easy to use messaging client.

Currently, we're focusing on implementing [Matrix](https://matrix.org),
but in the future we may extend or even build something new!

On a technical level, this client is a PWA built with SvelteKit.
This means it'll work on any device!
